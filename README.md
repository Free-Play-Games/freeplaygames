## Creating a Proxy
You are allowed to create a proxy and then add your Proxy to the proxy list below (create a PR). Here's how:
### 1. Create a fork
[Fork this repository](https://github.com/Free-Play-Games/freeplaygames/fork), choose the correct name and owner, and **MAKE SURE THAT YOU** untick the "Copy the `main` branch only" box.<br>

### 2. Go to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and sign up
You need to sign up for [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). Once done, you will be in the Cloudflare dashboard.

### 3. Click "Create application"

### 4. Setting up

Select your repository from your organization and click "Begin setup"

### 5. Changing the Defalt Deployment Branch

This is the hardest part of setup. Make sure that you **CHANGE THE BRANCH** to the `stable` branch (this is where everything to do with the website is hosted).

### 6. Almost Done
Now you have created a proxy! The only thing that you need to do is continually check the repo and click "Update branch" whenever there is a new update.<br>

### 6. Adding your website to the [Proxy Websites List](https://github.com/Free-Play-Games/freeplaygames/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#proxy-websites)
By default, all proxy websites are in the [unverified section](https://github.com/Free-Play-Games/freeplaygames/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#unverified) section. To add your website, use markdown to link your proxy website, and then add `<Br>` at the end.<br>
```[name.pages.dev](https://name.pages.dev)<br>```<br>
Then, commit your changes to your repository with the commit description of `Add (your website name)`<br>
![image](https://github.com/Free-Play-Games/freeplaygames/assets/119540345/17974dfe-8080-4cb9-a1a8-8b110f074601)<br>

![image](https://github.com/Free-Play-Games/freeplaygames/assets/119540345/4968cb48-6594-4ff8-ba43-84cdc7921326)
No description is required for the pull request. Our team will then merge your pull request into our repository, officially adding your repo! Your PR will be denied if it is not in the "Unverified" section.
